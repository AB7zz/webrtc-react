# How to start this app

1. Open your terminal
2. Type "npm start"
3. Open another tab in your terminal and type in "cd src" *Click Enter* and then "cd backend" and type in "npm run dev"
4. Hopefully that should work!


# How to test this app

1. Open localhost:3000, or which ever port your localhost is connected to. Open another in incognito mode
2. Enter the respective names on both tabs
3. Click on "Copy ID" from the other tab and put it inside your tab and click the call icon
4. Answer the call from the other tab
5. And you're good to go!

# Drawbacks

1. If you refresh the tab, the connection will automatically get cut and the server will restart
2. If you end the call, you must refresh the tab to make another call

# Happy Coding!
